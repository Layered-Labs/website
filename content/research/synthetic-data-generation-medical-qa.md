title: "Why Synthetic Longitudinal Data Is the Right Starting Point"

Real longitudinal patient data is scarce, sensitive, and ethically constrained. IRB approval, de-identification, and institutional access requirements make it an impractical foundation for early-stage research. We use synthetic patient trajectories instead, and we think this is the right call.

Synthetic data lets us define ground truth. A synthetic patient's medication adherence rate is known exactly. Their symptom trajectory was generated by a controlled process. When we evaluate whether a model correctly summarizes that trajectory, we have a precise answer, not a human annotation that may itself be inconsistent.

The limitation is real: synthetic trajectories may not capture the full complexity of real longitudinal behavior. We are transparent about this. As the health companion matures and users opt into research participation, the synthetic benchmarks will be supplemented with real data. For now, synthetic is faster, more controllable, and publishable without institutional overhead.
